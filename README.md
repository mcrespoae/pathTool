## Available scripts
### Copy files and folders path
This script will convert macOS server paths into ready to use Windows paths. Also, it will open Skype so you can paste it. In order to use it, select one or more folder or files from the server and use the script. It will copy and transform the paths to your clipboard.
* Assign cmd+U.

### Convert text path
This script will convert macOS server paths into ready to use Windows paths or vice versa. If the original path is a macOS path it will also open Skype so you can paste it. If the original path is a Windows server path, it will open a finder folder with the converted path.

To use it, select a path as a text in any app. Then use the script. It will detect if the path is from the Windows or the macOS side and it will transform it automatically.
* Assign cmd+alt+ctrl+U.
